#1BTD Toolbox has been updated!
- Current version number: 0.1.5

#1Main Changes:
- We added a web browser and BTD Modding tutorials. You can now watch tutorials or music INSIDE toolbox
- A new design theme
- fixed every bug we could find. Toolbox is much stable now.
- Added NKHook support AND a One-Click "Add New Tower" button (currently disabled until NKH is released)
- A lot of smaller things you'll notice over time, like an "About Us" button and "Export Console Log"
- Console Log is stored locally, so if Toolbox crashes you can find out why
- Rewrote a good chunk of code so things should be at least a little faster
- Way more

#1Special thank you:
We've come a very long way. Thanks for being patient while we worked on Toolbox. I hope you continue to enjoy it :)
