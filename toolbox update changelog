#1BTD Toolbox updated!
- Current version number: 0.1.0

#1Main Changes:
- A new JSON Editor with TABS!! FINALLY!!!
- Can now autoscroll to bad json. No more trying to find it
- Can restore previous sessions when restarting toolbox
- Bugfix from 0.0.9 that caused toolbox to crash

#1Smaller Changes:
- Can now make new projects without having the game installed (for android users)
    - To use this, when making a new project click "from Jet (no game)" 
- Can restore modded files to their original version
    - Just right click on them in the Jet Viewer
    - You need to have a backup project made. A new one will automatically be made when you create your next project.

#2Side note:
- BTD Toolbox has come a long way since it's first Alpha release, with many bugs fixed and new features added. Considering all the improvments made over time the first official release will be coming soon
- Thanks to everyone who helped test and support BTD Toolbox up until now :)
